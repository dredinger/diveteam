		<dt class="col-sm-3">What Is The Deep Blue Sea Foundation Anyway?</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9">The Deep Blue Sea Foundation is a non-profit organization that supports the volunteer program at Landry's Downtown Aquarium.</dd>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 offset-sm-3">The Downtown Aquarium has approximately 106,500 square feet of exhibit space, over one million gallons of water and approximately 500 species of fish, birds, and mammals.</dd>
		
		<dt class="col-sm-3">Who Is The Deep Blue Sea Foundation?</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9">The Aquarium has paid staff members in several departments including Aquarists, Trainers, Life Support, Education, Guest Services, Security, Sales, Housekeeping, and in the restaurant and lounge.</dd>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 offset-sm-3">We have over 200 volunteers in several areas of the Aquarium. Our volunteers run the gamut from ages 17 to 85 and include aspiring marine biologists, ocean-starved divers, and people who just love the Aquarium! About half of the volunteers participate as Aquarium Guides and greet our guests along the exhibit paths. THe other half are in a variety of behind the scenes positions working with our life sciences, education, and adminstrative staff.</dd>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 offset-sm-3" style="padding-bottom: 10px">The Aquarium has been owned by Landry's Restaurants, Inc. since March of 2003. Landry's owns many restaurants nationwide including local restaurants such as Saltgrass Steak House, Simms Steakhous, Oceanaire, and Chart House. Landry's also owns a Downtown Aquarium that opened in Houston in 2003. Previously operated as a private non-profit aquarium known as Ocean Journey, the Downtown Aquarium is now part of a larger for-profit restaurant/entertainment company.</dd>

		<dt class="col-sm-3">What Do The Volunteers Do?</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9">Volunteer Aquarium Guides ARE the educational link between guests and our exhibits.</dd>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 offset-sm-3">Behind the scenes volunteers support the staff in the maintenance of our exhibits and the care of our animals.</dd>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 offset-sm-3">Aquarium Guides work once a week and life science volunteers can commit to a weekly or every other week commitment of a 3-4 hour shift. The minimum commitment is for 6 months; 1 year for divers.</dd>

		<dt class="col-sm-3">How Are The Volunteers Trained?</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9">Most of the training is on-the-job.</dd>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 offset-sm-3">Aquarium Guides will mentor with experienced journey guides on each station and participate in a 4-hour training session that is held once a month.</dd>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 offset-sm-3">Behind the Scenes volunteers will be trained on-the-job by a staff member or an experienced volunteer.</dd>

		<dt class="col-sm-3">What's In It For Me?</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9">Other than being a fun place to learn fascinating things about the animal collection, the Deep Blue Sea Foundation provides additional benefits to the volunteers.</dd>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 offset-sm-3">Volunteers are admitted for free anytime during business hours.</dd>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 offset-sm-3">Educational sessions, called enrichments, are held at minimum 3 times a year and are available to all Foundation volunteers.</dd>

		<dt class="col-sm-3">Getting Signed Up</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9">Once you have decided on a position, call on of our Volunteer Coordinators at 303-561-4474 or 303-561-4413 to set up an interview. All volunteers are interviewed and background checked before starting. A drug test is also required. Keep in mind, some positions have a waitlist and you may not be able to start that position right away. Call immediately to make an appointment for an interview.</dd>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 offset-sm-3">Volunteer Divers will receive another packet at the diver interview that includes a dive physical form. The physical must be filled out by your doctor on our form. We also require current CPR certification for divers. Once the interview, background check, physical and CPR certification is complete, all divers are required to pass a swim test and checkout dive with our Dive Safety Officer, or their designee.</dd>

The volunteer fee covers the cost of your uniform shirt, security badge, and training manual; dive candidates receive additional testing and training.</dd>
